Welcome to **SQL_Notes**!

I created this repository to share all the SQL notes I used during my learning journey. Whether you're just starting or looking to deepen your SQL knowledge, you'll find valuable information and examples here.

## What's Inside:
- Basic SQL queries
- Joins, Subqueries, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- SQL functions and aggregate operations
- Views, indexes, and performance tuning
- Advanced topics: window functions, recursive queries, and more!

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to make this repository even better.

Happy learning!
